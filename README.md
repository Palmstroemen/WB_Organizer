# WorkbenchOrganizer
A workbench organizer widget for FreeCAD.

The aim of the workbench organizer (WBO) is to organize the long list of workbenches into meaningful groups.

The WBO provides **workbench groups** with an **additional selector** to first select a group of workbenches which then allows to select a workbench from a (reduced) group of workbenches with the aim to make it easier to find your workbenches.

It also allows to present the workbenches in tabs or in a dropdown list.

It allows to put **one workbench in multiple groups**. So i.e. the Spreadsheet-Workbench might appear in multiple groups.

It even allows to put workbenches <u>into the group-selector dropdown</u>. This might be useful for workbenches like Spreadsheet that you might want to put in many groups.

It further allows to <u>rename workbenches</u> whether to translate or to give it a - for you - more meaningful name. In the videos above you can see, that we have renamed several workbenches in German language. Like 'Spreadsheet' --> 'Tabellen'

Of course, you also find an 'All'-workbenches group to access workbenches the traditional way.

## Preferences dialog
A <u>WorkbenchOrganizer preferences</u> dialog can be accessed from within the groups-dropdown or under __menu -> Accessories -> WorkbenchOrganizer__.

To be honest, the preferences dialog at the moment is quite rudimentary.
For an introduction to how to create and modify your workbenches, see [instructions.txt](./Resources/Instructions.txt)

_In case our WorkbenchOrganizer finds some fans, we'll continue to improve it. For the moment, this is our MVP (minimal valuable product)._
